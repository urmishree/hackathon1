# AccidentAssist — Intelligent Accident Response

When an accident happens, most customers panic and don’t know the next step: call police, ambulance, fire, insurer, or a relative? **AccidentAssist** solves this confusion with an **agentic multi-agent system** that automates triage, dispatch, and communication.

## 🚗 Problem
- Lack of clarity on whom to call first.
- Delay in arranging towing, repairs, and notifying key contacts.
- No real-time updates for customers.

---

## ✅ Solution
An **Agentic-powered orchestration system** where different agents handle specific roles:

- **RM Agent**: Collects info, location, runs “drivable?” check.
- **Tow Agent**: Dispatches tow truck if not drivable, updates status.
- **Service Station Agent**: Registers case, notifies customer & RM.
- **Notifier**: Sends updates via **Email / SMS / WhatsApp** at every stage.
